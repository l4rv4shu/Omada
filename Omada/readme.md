Test scripts are using pre-defined screenshot as additional references for assertions.
Provided reference screenshots may not match, due to different screen resolution, browser, etc.
In such case, before 'real' execution, run tests one time, collect screenshots and put them into proper folders as references.
(Normally, I would come up with some script-solution to do so, but I will skip it for now)
